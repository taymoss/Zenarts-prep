    <p1>
        On the Zen Arts web page anyone who goes there on first sight might just say that it is just like any other regular website that is on the internet. At first glance and with no context going into it; it does seem that way. However this simply is not the case. As you read the website, it begins to tell you that there are other templates that you are able to choose from, and that each of them are unique in their own right. This is because they all have CSS added to them all created by seperate users that causes them to be unique. This site is very cool because it gives different ways to look at CSS, and it also gives the code that they used in order for them to get it running the way that it is.The site is cool because it gives me some inspiration to do a little more delving into the world of CSS and see what it has to offer. The more I figure out here, the more effective I could be at incorporating it into my own work.

    My Favorite Template
    </h1>
    <p1>My favorite template was apothecary because it was the most eye appealing with the way it looked like a book. It also incorporated a bunch of pictures and the design and layout of the page was interesting to say the least. The way the page navigated around the previous ideas was interesting and it left a lasting impression on me. It reminded me of a book or a textbook and that was very memorable because I was not expecting that out of a website. Also the CSS incorporated was interesting as well, some of the CSS that was incorporated was:
    </p1>
    <ul>
        <li>font family</li>
        <li>color</li>
        <li>background</li>
    </ul>
    <p1>These are just the basic CSS things included. He included some outside of the book such as:</p1>
    <ul>
        <li>padding bottom</li>
    <li>vertical-align</li>
    <li>webkit box sizing</li>
    </ul>
